# bunnysim2000
rabbit-based terminal graphic simulator, built for <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/agnes/12.html">
interfaces week</a> of the course <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/">How To Make Almost Anything</a>.<br><br>

This code relies on the library bunnysay, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/co60ca/bunnysay/tree/master/src">
here</a>. To adapt the code for your use (e.g. not a serial port interface), edit the function getPulses() to modify the input type.
<br><br>
A smaller number of pulses makes the bunny go faster, and vice versa.
